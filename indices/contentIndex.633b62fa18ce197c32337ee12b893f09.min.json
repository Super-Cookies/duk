What I will write is a brief summary (and for some parts you will have to look at the pdf).\n\n**Method 1: Projective Maps**\n\n- A *projective map* is a function between two objects on which *cross-ratio* is defined which preserves *cross-ratio* e.g. inversion is a *projective map*\n- If two maps coincide at 3 distinct points, they must be the same map (arises from the definition of *cross-ratio*)\n- Therefore, in a problem, if you can characterised the given condition as a projective map, the statement-to-prove as another, and show they coincide at 3 distinct points, they must always coincide e.g. they must be the same one, proving the problem with just 3 cases!","lastmodified":"2023-05-24T14:17:08.504781426Z","tags":[]},"/normal_stuff":{"title":"Normal Geometry Techniques","content":"","lastmodified":"2023-05-24T14:17:08.504781426Z","tags":[]},"/nt_constructions":{"title":"Constructions in Number Theory","content":"","lastmodified":"2023-05-24T14:17:08.504781426Z","tags":[]},"/number_theory":{"title":"Number Theory","content":"\n- [[basic_nt]]\n- [[primes]]\n- [[modulo]]\n- [[diophantine]]\n- [[nt_constructions]]","lastmodified":"2023-05-24T14:17:08.504781426Z","tags":[]},"/op_theorems":{"title":"OP Theorems","content":"\ninteresting","lastmodified":"2023-05-24T14:17:08.504781426Z","tags":[]},"/polynomial":{"title":"Polynomials","content":"","lastmodified":"2023-05-24T14:17:08.504781426Z","tags":[]},"/primes":{"title":"Primes","content":"","lastmodified":"2023-05-24T14:17:08.504781426Z","tags":[]},"/projective":{"title":"Projective Geometry","content":"\ninteresting","lastmodified":"2023-05-24T14:17:08.504781426Z","tags":[]}}
