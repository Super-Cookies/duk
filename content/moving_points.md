Projective!
Hopefully if you're reading this you're already comfortable (somewhat) with [[projective]] geometry. If not, you should learn about it.
Basically everything on here is sourced from [this paper](https://cdn.bc-pf.org/resources/math/geometry/bash/Vladyslav_Zveryk-The_Method_of_Moving_Points.pdf)this paper</a>, so I would highly recommend reading it before this. What I will write is a brief summary (and for some parts you will have to look at the pdf)
