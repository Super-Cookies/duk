Projective!


Hopefully if you're reading this you're already comfortable (somewhat) with [[projective]] geometry. If not, you should learn about it.
Basically everything on here is sourced from [this paper](https://cdn.bc-pf.org/resources/math/geometry/bash/Vladyslav_Zveryk-The_Method_of_Moving_Points.pdf), so I would highly recommend reading it before this. What I will write is a brief summary (and for some parts you will have to look at the pdf).

**Method 1: Projective Maps**

- A *projective map* is a function between two objects on which *cross-ratio* is defined which preserves *cross-ratio* e.g. inversion is a *projective map*
- If two maps coincide at 3 distinct points, they must be the same map (arises from the definition of *cross-ratio*)
- Therefore, in a problem, if you can characterised the given condition as a projective map, the statement-to-prove as another, and show they coincide at 3 distinct points, they must always coincide e.g. they must be the same one, proving the problem with just 3 cases!
